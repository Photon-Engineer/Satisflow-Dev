Hello and thank you for your visiting this repo!

This goal of this project is to provide a helpful tool for the game [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/). The tool is a flow-based calculator where you can add nodes and make connections for the purpose of planning out each part. This is tool is designed from the ground up with interactivity in mind. It allows you to save the output as text to be able to reload previous work. The tool makes use of [Rete JS](https://github.com/retejs/rete) and several of its plugins to accomplish this. This project would not have been kicked off without their initial work.

Some notes about me: I am not a web-designer or software engineer in any respect. I had to learn some HTML, JS, and React just to start this project. While I do have some background in programming in java and matlab, I am 100% self-taught. There will likley be bugs and incompatibilities I have not thought of. 

If you are interested in contributing to the project, let me know. This is also my first github project, so please be patient as I learn the ropes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
